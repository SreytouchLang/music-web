```

- Create a new branch for your contribution:

```sh
git checkout -b feat/issue-id/feature-name

- **UI/UX Improvements 🎨** - Enhance the user interface and user experience.

3️⃣ **Code Guidelines**

- Follow **Prettier** and **ESLint** for consistent code formatting.
- Ensure all code is properly commented and documented.
- **Commit messages** should follow the convention:

We're expecting to see proper commit messages with the following format:

```js
 <type>(optional scope): <description>(#<ISSUE_ID>)
```

An example commit message:

```js
feat(core): add useAwesome hook (#1234)
```
```js
feat: Added new feature or Component
fix:  Resolve the bug
docs: Updated documentation
chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation.
```

4️⃣ **Testing**

- Run tests before submitting a pull request:

```sh
npm test
```

- Ensure all tests pass before submitting your contribution.

5️⃣ **Submitting a Pull Request**

- Push your changes to your forked repository.
- Open a **pull request (PR)** to the **main** branch.
- Provide a clear description of your changes.

```js
feat: added x feature #ISSUE_ID

Now with x feature, you can do y.

Resolves #ISSUE_ID
```

or

```js
fix: issue with x. #ISSUE_ID

We had an edge where it causes x issue to happen, now it's fixed.

Fixes #ISSUE_ID
```

- Wait for a project maintainer to review and merge your PR.
